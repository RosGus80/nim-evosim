# Competitive evolution simulator in terminal

### A competitive 2-player game that is to be played inside the terminal (will potentially switch to some GUI if game becomes larger than what terminal can handle)

Players would need to seed their species with certain traits, choosing between various characteristics like vision range, speed, size, etc. \
After animals were created, they go on and compete for food in a field shared with all other animals. Those who are fed get a chance to reproduce and give random mutations to the new generation while those who were less lucky die. \
Idea is largely inspired by [Primer's](https://www.youtube.com/@PrimerBlobs) youtube [video series](https://youtu.be/0ZGbIKd0XrM?si=DMAbrUbNpqZQr2PC)
